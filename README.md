# graph-statistics
The repositery contains code which evaluate the graph statistics computed approximately with respect to actual values. The graphs in question are large, for which evaluation of exact statistics are slow and even impossible in some cases. 
Approximate method as developed as in [1] which uses Flajolet-Marten algorithm[2]  is implemented.
